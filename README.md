# Pokemon Generation 3 Living Dex

This is the documentation and archive for my challenge run of
[completing a Generation 3 living dex](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pok%C3%A9dex).

> A living Pokédex is a fan term for a game which not only has a complete
> Pokédex, but has one of every available species of Pokémon stored in its PC
> boxes as well, usually in their National Pokédex order. It follows the most
> literal interpretation of the slogan of the series, "Gotta catch 'em all!".

I grew up playing the generation 3 Pokemon games and want to fully go back and
get a full complete experience of the games.

In addition to the living dex, I also have other goals I wish to accomplish.

## Rules

### Tools

- Emulation and speed up is allowed, otherwise I'd go insane with the time
  investment required.
- No cheating at ALL. No glitches, exploits, or action replay rom hacks.
  - **PokeHex can exceptionally be used to view save data but NOT write or
    modify it.**
- Event distribution roms for unobtainable legendaries are fair game as long as
  I use mystery gift or link cable functionality.
  - Event pokemon cannot be inserted using PokeHex or Action Replay cheats.
- ONLY the Vanilla games can be played. No quality of life rom hacks are allowed
  for a full authentic experience.
- Trading and linking between games is allowed and necessary for trade
  evolutions.
  - Trading cannot happen during the main story unless I want a trade evolution.
  - Trading can be used and is encouraged for having the best Pokemon from
    previous runs be used for Battle Frontier and Colosseums.

### Game

- Set mode for battles.
- Every Pokemon in must be caught with ONLY a Pokeball.
  - Safari Zone pokemon will need to utilize breeding.
- All Pokemon must be nicknamed.

### Nuzlocke

Ruby and FireRed will be ran using Hardcore nuzlocke rules to spice things up
during my living dex run:

1. Once a Pokémon faints it is considered dead and cannot be used anymore.
2. You can only catch your first encounter in every area.
3. You must nickname every Pokémon.
4. Once you white out the run is over.
5. You cannot use items in battle. Held items are allowed.
6. You have to change the Battle-Style to "Set".
7. You cannot level past the next Gym Leaders strongest Pokémon.
8. Gift Pokémon/Static Pokémon are allowed, as long as they are your first
   encounter.
9. Once the champion has been defeated, the Nuzlocke rules are lifted to allow
   for catching version exclusives for the living dex.
