# Pokemon Generation 3 Living Dex

This is the documentation and storage for my challenge run of [completing a Generation 3 living dex](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pok%C3%A9dex).

I grew up playing the generation 3 Pokemon games and want to fully go back and complete many different goals:

- Gold Symbols in Battle Frontier
- A full "living dex".
- Clearing Mt Battle and Orre Colosseum in the GameCube games.
- Battle Tower streak
- Fully completed contest and ribbon run.

## Emulators

Will be using mgba for the game boy games, and Dolphin for the gamecube ones.

## Rules

- Emulation and speed up is allowed, otherwise I'd go insane with the time investment required.
- Every game in Gen 3 must be completed including its post game content.
- Set mode for battles, with level cap enforcement using the lowest level gym leader's pokemon as the cap.
- For the main story mode, the teams for each game are randomized with Pokemon I've never used before for some distinct variety and challenges.
- Can only use Pokeballs items in battles.
- Every Pokemon in the living dex must be caught with a Pokeball.
    - Safari Zone pokemon will need to utilize breeding.
- No cheating at ALL. No glitches, exploits, or action replay rom hacks.
    - **PokeHex can be used** just to see the EVs and IVs of Pokemon for sanity.
- Event Pokemon must be obtained using the roms that contain the event for a near legit experience.
- Only the vanilla games can be played.
- Can ONLY play [Gen 3 games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_III). This goes from Ruby/Sapphire to Emerald and includes the gameboy releases.
