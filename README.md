# Pokemon Generation 3 Living Dex

This is the documentation and archive for my challenge run of [completing a Generation 3 living dex](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pok%C3%A9dex).

> A living Pokédex is a fan term for a game which not only has a complete Pokédex, but has one of every available species of Pokémon stored in its PC boxes as well, usually in their National Pokédex order. It follows the most literal interpretation of the slogan of the series, "Gotta catch 'em all!".

I grew up playing the generation 3 Pokemon games and want to fully go back and get a full complete experience of the games.

In addition to the living dex, I also have other goals I wish to accomplish.

## Rules

### Tools

- Emulation and speed up is allowed, otherwise I'd go insane with the time investment required.
- No cheating at ALL. No glitches, exploits, or action replay rom hacks.
    - **PokeHex can exceptionally be used to view save data but NOT write or modify it.**
- Event distribution roms for unobtainable legendaries are fair game as long as I use mystery gift or link cable functionality.
    - Event pokemon cannot be inserted using PokeHex or Action Replay cheats.
- ONLY the Vanilla games can be played. No quality of life rom hacks are allowed for a full authentic experience.
- Trading and linking between games is allowed and necessary for trade evolutions.
    - Trading cannot happen during the main story unless I want a trade evolution.
    - Trading can be used and is encouraged for having the best Pokemon from previous runs be used for Battle Frontier and Colosseums.

### Game

- Set mode for battles, with level cap enforcement using the lowest level gym leader's pokemon as the cap.
- For the main story mode, the teams for each game are randomized with Pokemon I've never used before for some distinct variety and challenges.
- Can only use Pokeballs in battles.
- Every Pokemon in must be caught with ONLY a Pokeball.
    - Safari Zone pokemon will need to utilize breeding.
